# E-commerce Website Testing

End-to-end test suite for the demo store at `https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io`, created as part of the recruitment process for **S&P**.

## Tech stack

- Cypress 15 (E2E mode)
- TypeScript
- Page Object Model
- Faker for synthetic test data
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Configure environment variables used by the tests:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # fill in TEST_LOGIN and TEST_PASSWORD in the .env file
   ```

## Key npm scripts

- `npm run cy:open` - launches Cypress in interactive mode.
- `npm run cy:run` - runs the full suite headlessly (Chrome by default).
- `npm run lint` - lints the codebase.
- `npm run format` - formats the code with Prettier.

## Project structure

- `cypress/e2e` - test scenarios, e.g. `02_registration.cy.ts`.
- `cypress/support/page-objects` - page objects that wrap UI interactions.
- `cypress/support/factories` - test data builders.
- `cypress.config.ts` - Cypress configuration (baseUrl, viewport, retries, etc.).

## Test coverage

- **Authentication shortcut** - `cy.login()` uses `.env` credentials to enter the app without UI login steps.
- **Sanity checks** - `01_sanity.cy.ts` runs lightweight storefront smoke tests helpful for quick regressions.
- **Registration flow** - `02_registration.cy.ts` creates a new customer with Faker data and verifies the success banner and account dashboard access.
- **Search and filters** - `03_search.cy.ts` checks keyword search results, validates automatic price filter bounds, forces empty results by pushing the price beyond available products, and asserts that every paginated page respects the chosen range.
- **Basket interactions** - `04_basket.cy.ts` adds a product from search results, verifies the success toast, checks the cart page entry, and cleans up by emptying the basket.

## Page object highlights

- `SearchPage` centralizes selectors for the search module, contains helpers for synchronous price filtering (`setPriceFilter`, `setPriceFilterBeyondResults`), and traverses pagination while asserting price ranges.
- `RegistrationPage` exposes high-level form actions (filling contact details, opting into newsletters, submitting the form), keeping specs free from raw selectors.
- `BasketPage` wraps common cart actions such as emptying the basket via the inline remove buttons and asserting that specific products are present.

## Running focused tests

- Headless single spec: `npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/03_search.cy.ts`
- Interactive single spec: `npx cypress open --e2e --config specPattern=cypress/e2e/02_registration.cy.ts`

Both commands assume `.env` is populated with valid credentials.

## Reports

- HTML run summary is generated by `cypress-mochawesome-reporter` when you execute `npm run cy:run`.
- The latest report is written to `cypress/reports/index.html`; screenshots for failed assertions are embedded directly in the report.
- Because `overwrite` is enabled, each new run replaces the previous HTML to keep the folder tidy; archive the file manually if you need historical runs.
- Open the report locally with your browser of choice, for example: `start cypress/reports/index.html` on Windows or `open cypress/reports/index.html` on macOS.

## TODO - Future improvements

- **CI/CD setup** - Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution
- **Mobile/responsive testing** - Add tests for different viewport sizes and mobile devices
- **Accessibility testing** - Add WCAG compliance tests and screen reader support
- **API testing** - Add API layer tests to complement E2E testing
- **Performance metrics** - Add test execution time tracking and success rate monitoring
